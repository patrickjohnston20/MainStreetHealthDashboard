# MainStreetHealthDashboard

## Overview
Welcome to the MainStreetHealthDashboard repository! My project is a mock dashboard designed to showcase real data obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The primary objective of this dashboard is to provide healthcare insights on rural areas, aligning with Main Street's core values.

## Data Analysis
The data used in this project has undergone a comprehensive cleaning and analysis process. Initially, I explored some in SQL and then proceeded with excel.  The data was organized into multiple pivot tables to facilitate further analysis. From these tables, I created/designed various visuals and charts to represent the information effectively.

## Interactive Dashboard
The key outcome of this project is an interactive dashboard that offers an intuitive and visually appealing way to explore the data. I wanted to incorporat the Main Street Health logo and utilized their hexcode colors for a cohesive and branded design. This not only adds a professional touch but also demonstrates a commitment to attention to detail with special mentioning for brownie points!

## Future Exploration
While this dashboard provides valuable insights into rural healthcare data, there is still much to explore and uncover. Given more time and resources, I plan to dig even deeper into the data, potentially uncovering additional insights that can drive meaningful change.
